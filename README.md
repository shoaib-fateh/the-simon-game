# The Simon Game

The Simon Game is a classic memory game where players must remember and repeat a sequence of button presses. The game starts with a single button lighting up, and the player must click that button. Then, the game adds another button to the sequence, and the player must repeat the entire sequence correctly. The game continues to add buttons to the sequence, challenging the player's memory. The goal is to see how long the player can remember and repeat the sequence correctly.

## How to Play

1. Press the "A" key to start the game.
2. One of the 4 buttons will quickly change color.
3. Click the button that changed color.
4. Each time you click the correct button, your level will increase.
5. The game will repeat and you must remember and click the sequence of buttons correctly, starting from the first button and adding one more button each time.
